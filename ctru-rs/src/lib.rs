//! Safe and idiomatic Rust wrapper around [`libctru`](https://github.com/devkitPro/libctru).
//!
//! # About
//!
//! This crate behaves as the main tool to access system-specific functionality on the Nintendo 3DS when developing homebrew software in Rust.
//! Thanks to it, developers can develop userland applications by accessing access the underlying system services and the console's hardware
//! (such as [HID devices](crate::services::hid), [network capabilities](crate::services::soc), [graphics](crate::services::gfx), [built-in cameras](crate::services::cam), etc.).
//!
//! Among these features, [`ctru-rs`](crate) also automatically includes functionality to properly integrate the Rust `std` with the console's operating system,
//! which the developer would otherwise need to implement manually.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Thoroughly read the official [`ctru-rs` wiki](https://github.com/rust3ds/ctru-rs/wiki) which guides you through the setup needed to install the required toolchain and helpful tools.
//! After following the guide and understanding the many quirks of the Nintendo 3DS homebrew development environment, you can create a new project by including this crate as a dependency
//! in your `Cargo.toml` manifest and build your binaries either manually (for the `armv6k-nintendo-3ds` target) or via [`cargo-3ds`](https://github.com/rust3ds/cargo-3ds).
