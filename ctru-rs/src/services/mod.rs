//! OS services used to handle system-specific functionality.
//!
//! Most of the 3DS console's functionalities (when writing user-land homebrew) are accessible via services,
//! which need to be initialized before accessing any particular feature.
//!
//! To ensure safety while using the underlying services, [`ctru-rs`](crate) leverages Rust's lifetime model.
//! After initializing the handle for a specific service (e.g. [`Apt`](apt::Apt)) the service will be accessible as long as there is at least one handle "alive".
//! As such, handles should be dropped *after* the use of a specific service. This is particularly important for services which are necessary for functionality
//! "outside" their associated methods, such as [`RomFS`](romfs::RomFS), which creates an accessible virtual filesystem, or [`Soc`](soc::Soc),
//! which enables all network communications via sockets.
//!
//! In [`ctru-rs`](crate) some services only allow a single handle to be created at a time, to ensure a safe and controlled environment.
